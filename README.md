Introduction to Machine Learning: Spring 2022 Projects

This repository contains the code for projects 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 from the Intro. to ML course offered at ETH, Spring 2022. 
All projects were completed collaboratively by Levi Lingsch, Jonas Gruetter, and Fabiano Sasselli. 

Due to restrictions specified by the instructors, the training and test data may not be included in this repo. We simply provide the code to illustrate the methods used to obtain a solution to each project. We used a variety of libraries, but primarily relied on TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and SciKit Learn for machine learning components, as well as Numpy and Pandas for data processing.
